## The structure of the documentation

The documentation is divided into four folders. Most documentation will be in english.
- *norsk*: This folder contains documentation for SSB internally. It is intended to be used for beginners and will be limited in the amount of topics covered. The focus is on on-boarding.
- *tutorials*: This folder contains tutorials for the different packages. The tutorials are intended to be used as a starting point for new users. They are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to give an overview of the package and its capabilities.
- *how-to*: This folder contains how-tos for the different packages. The how-tos are intended to be used as a reference for more advanced users. They are not intended to be exhaustive, but show some pratical examples of how to solve some problems.
- *explanations*: This folder contains explanations of the different packages. The explanations are intended to be used as a reference for more advanced users. They are intended to be focused on the overarching principles of the package and the thinking that lead up to its current shape.

You can find the reference documentation in the docstrings, and as a part of the github pages.
