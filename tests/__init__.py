"""Test suite for the ssb_dash_framework package.

test_basic_usage.py:
    Here basic usage will be tested to ensure that we shield users from unnecessary breaking changes.
    Tests should cover the expected/supported ways to use our API to build an app.

In the module_tests folder each module gets its own tests.
We want users to import modules from the top level, so make sure to add tests that ensure this is working as intended (from ssb_dash_framework import module).
- This lets us refactor and organize the code in different ways if needed, without introducing breaking changes.
