## Before-release checklist

In order to keep this library stable for production apps, follow these steps before releasing a new stable version.

- If breaking changes, make a list of them and a guide for updating.
- Ensure that all tests pass.
- Make sure all demos are up to date and working.
- Create a pre-release or stable version on the 'develop' branch and have it tested by several users to ensure compatibility.
  - Pre-release are made by adding 'a' to the version number like '0.2.0a1'
  - Testpypi is continously updated with the content from the develop 'branch' and can be used for early testing.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.10+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox]
- [nox-poetry]

Install [pipx]:

```console
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
```

Install [Poetry]:

```console
pipx install poetry
```

Install [Nox] and [nox-poetry]:

```console
pipx install nox
pipx inject nox nox-poetry
```

Install the pre-commit hooks

```console
nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session, or your app:

```console
poetry run python
poetry run ssb-dash-framework
```

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.

## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.
