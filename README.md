## Installation

You can install _SSB Sirius Dash_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
pip install ssb-dash-framework
```
or using poetry:
```console
poetry add ssb-dash-framework
```

The above will install the latest stable release.

### Installing the pre-release version

This version contains new features and improvements that are heading to the stable release eventually, but is still subject to changes.

```console
poetry add ssb-dash-framework --allow-prereleases
```

### Installing the development version

This is the currently in-development version. Be aware that this is a very unstable version and is subject to rapid breaking changes.
- Primarily intended for testing of in-development features.

First make sure this is in your pyproject.toml:

> [[tool.poetry.source]]<br>
>name = "testpypi"<br>
>url = "https://test.pypi.org/simple"<br>
>priority = "supplemental"<br>

It can be added manually or using the command below.

```console
poetry source add --priority=supplemental testpypi https://test.pypi.org/simple
```

If it is in your pyproject.toml, run this command with --allow-prereleases to ensure you get the latest version.

```console
poetry add --source testpypi ssb-dash-framework --allow-prereleases
```
