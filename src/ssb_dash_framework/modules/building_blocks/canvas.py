    It is intended to be used when you want to combine other building blocks into a single view.

    Its limitation is that it does not support any interactivity on its own, and no callbacks are defined.
    It is meant to be used as a container for other components, such as tables, graphs and similar.

    It can to a degree replace the need for a completely custom module, but if you need interactivity
    between the contained modules directly, instead of routing it through the variable selector,
    you should consider creating a custom module instead.
